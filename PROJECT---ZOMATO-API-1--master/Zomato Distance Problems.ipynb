Scrumptious barbeque starters with grilled chicken,fish tikka in skewers on the table. Sipped on a variety of mocktails plus the singer was there to entertain throughout our time there. The main course dishes were made very well with excellent sea food, dum biryani , paneer dishes, types of breads and exquisite desserts to choose from namely white chocolate brownie , pineapple pastries , truffle cake and cut fruits. Would definitely recommend to one and all.\n",
      "Piyush Matreja   5   Live singing, spectacular ambience and every one enjoying to the grilled kebabs on their table, that's Themis barbeque all about. Based on the concept of buffet where you start with snacks on the table with cool mocktails. I tried the lemon ice tea and charred prawns tikka as well as chicken malai tikka ,their non veg starters were great. Main course I had mutton rogan josh with lachha parantha and enjoyed a few of my favourite desserts namely strawberry tarts and a chocolate truffle cake with cherries. I must say that was a good lunch I relished after long.\n",
      "Kimaya Divya   5   A place offering a buffet concept in the northern part of Delhi, with live music , a dj set up, comfortable seating. They have a set up of a grill hot plate with food grilled on skewers. We opted for non veg set up and ate prawns , chicken malai tikka , tandoori chicken in the hot portion, while chilly fish ,pizzas and mutton seekh kebab were served separately. The main course had lots of variety with dal Makhani, paneer kadhai , mix vegetable, chicken pilaf ,mutton rogan josh. The restaurant did their level best and made our time a memorable one.\n",
